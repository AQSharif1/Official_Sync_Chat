# ✅ **ACCOUNT EXIT & AUTO-CLEANUP IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE**

## 🎯 **IMPLEMENTED FEATURES:**

### **✅ 1. Exit Option from Onboarding**
Users can now exit the account creation/onboarding process and return to the login/signup page.

**Changes Made:**
- **`OnboardingFlow.tsx`**: Added "Exit Account Creation" button in top-right corner
- **Full sign out**: Signs out user completely and redirects to login/signup page
- **Clean exit**: No partial account states or localStorage tracking

```typescript
// Added to OnboardingFlow.tsx
<Button
  variant="ghost"
  size="sm"
  onClick={async () => {
    try {
      // Sign out the user and redirect to auth page
      await signOut();
      toast({
        title: "Account creation cancelled",
        description: "You've been signed out. You can create an account again anytime.",
        variant: "default",
      });
      // Redirect to login/signup page
      window.location.href = '/';
    } catch (error) {
      console.error('Error signing out:', error);
      // Force redirect to login/signup page even if signout fails
      window.location.href = '/';
    }
  }}
  className="gap-2 text-muted-foreground hover:text-foreground"
>
  <LogOut className="w-4 h-4" />
  Exit Account Creation
</Button>
```

### **✅ 2. Auto-Delete Incomplete Accounts After 3 Days**
Accounts that don't complete onboarding within 3 days are automatically deleted.

**Database Functions Created:**
- `public.cleanup_incomplete_accounts()` - Main cleanup function
- `public.preview_cleanup_incomplete_accounts()` - Preview what would be deleted (for testing)
- `public.extend_account_by_completing_onboarding()` - Allows users to extend account by completing profile

**Cleanup Logic:**
```sql
-- Identifies users who:
-- 1. Created account more than 3 days ago
-- 2. Don't have a complete profile (no username or empty username)
-- 3. Are not already deleted

SELECT au.id, au.email, au.created_at
FROM auth.users au
LEFT JOIN public.profiles p ON au.id = p.user_id
WHERE au.created_at < (NOW() - INTERVAL '3 days')
AND (
    p.user_id IS NULL  -- No profile exists
    OR p.username IS NULL  -- Profile exists but incomplete
    OR p.username = ''     -- Empty username
)
AND au.deleted_at IS NULL
```

### **✅ 3. User Warning System**
Users are warned about account deletion and can complete their profile to prevent it.

**New Hook: `useAccountCleanup.ts`**
- Checks account completion status
- Shows warnings when account is at risk (2+ days old)
- Provides function to extend account by completing onboarding
- Integrates with existing onboarding system

**Warning Integration:**
- **Settings page**: Shows warning banner for at-risk accounts
- **Toast notifications**: Alerts users about pending deletion
- **One-time daily warnings**: Prevents spam notifications

### **✅ 4. Automatic Cleanup Integration**
When users complete onboarding, cleanup markers are cleared.

**Updated Files:**
- `useOnboardingCompletion.ts`: Clears localStorage markers on completion
- `OnboardingFlow.tsx`: Stores incomplete signup timestamp
- `SettingsView.tsx`: Shows account deletion warnings

## 🔧 **TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION:**

### **Frontend Changes:**
1. **`OnboardingFlow.tsx`**: Added exit button and skip functionality
2. **`Index.tsx`**: Added skip handler that stores timestamp
3. **`useAccountCleanup.ts`**: New hook for monitoring account status
4. **`SettingsView.tsx`**: Warning banner for at-risk accounts
5. **`useOnboardingCompletion.ts`**: Cleanup of localStorage on completion

### **Backend Changes:**
1. **`AUTO_CLEANUP_INCOMPLETE_ACCOUNTS.sql`**: Complete cleanup system
   - Cleanup function with error handling
   - Logging table for audit trail
   - Preview function for testing
   - Extension function for completing onboarding
   - RLS policies for security

### **Database Tables:**
- **`cleanup_log`**: Tracks all cleanup actions and errors
- **Indexes**: Performance optimization for cleanup queries
- **RLS Policies**: Secure access to cleanup logs

## 🧪 **HOW IT WORKS:**

### **User Flow - Exit Account Creation:**
1. User starts account creation/onboarding
2. User clicks "Exit Account Creation" button
3. System signs out the user completely
4. User redirected to login/signup page
5. User can create a new account or sign in to existing account

### **Auto-Cleanup Flow:**
1. **Daily cleanup** (requires pg_cron extension):
   ```sql
   SELECT cron.schedule('cleanup-incomplete-accounts', '0 2 * * *', 'SELECT public.cleanup_incomplete_accounts();');
   ```
2. **Manual cleanup** (for testing):
   ```sql
   SELECT public.cleanup_incomplete_accounts();
   ```
3. **Preview cleanup** (see what would be deleted):
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM public.preview_cleanup_incomplete_accounts();
   ```

### **Account Extension Flow:**
1. User sees deletion warning
2. User clicks "Complete Profile Setup Now"
3. User completes onboarding
4. System calls `extend_account_by_completing_onboarding()`
5. Account is saved from deletion
6. localStorage markers cleared

---

## 📋 **SETUP INSTRUCTIONS:**

### **1. Apply Database Functions:**
```sql
-- Run in Supabase SQL Editor:
-- Copy and paste contents of AUTO_CLEANUP_INCOMPLETE_ACCOUNTS.sql
```

### **2. Enable Automatic Cleanup (Optional):**
```sql
-- Enable pg_cron extension in Supabase Dashboard > Database > Extensions
-- Then run:
SELECT cron.schedule('cleanup-incomplete-accounts', '0 2 * * *', 'SELECT public.cleanup_incomplete_accounts();');
```

### **3. Test the System:**
```sql
-- Preview what would be cleaned up:
SELECT * FROM public.preview_cleanup_incomplete_accounts();

-- Run manual cleanup:
SELECT public.cleanup_incomplete_accounts();

-- Check cleanup history:
SELECT * FROM public.cleanup_log ORDER BY cleanup_date DESC;
```

## 🎉 **BENEFITS:**

### **✅ User Experience:**
- **No forced completion**: Users can exit onboarding and return later
- **Clear warnings**: Users know exactly when their account will be deleted
- **Easy completion**: One-click access to complete profile setup
- **Fair timeframe**: 3 days gives users adequate time

### **✅ Database Hygiene:**
- **Automatic cleanup**: Removes incomplete accounts without manual intervention
- **Audit trail**: Full logging of all cleanup actions
- **Safe deletion**: Soft delete preserves data integrity
- **Error handling**: Continues cleanup even if individual records fail

### **✅ Security & Privacy:**
- **RLS policies**: Secure access to cleanup functions
- **User control**: Users can extend accounts by completing setup
- **Transparent process**: Clear communication about deletion timeline

---

## 🔍 **MONITORING & MAINTENANCE:**

### **Check Cleanup Status:**
```sql
-- Recent cleanup activity
SELECT * FROM public.cleanup_log 
WHERE cleanup_date > NOW() - INTERVAL '7 days' 
ORDER BY cleanup_date DESC;

-- Users at risk of deletion
SELECT * FROM public.preview_cleanup_incomplete_accounts();
```

### **Account Statistics:**
```sql
-- Count of complete vs incomplete profiles
SELECT 
  CASE 
    WHEN p.username IS NOT NULL AND p.username != '' THEN 'Complete'
    ELSE 'Incomplete'
  END as profile_status,
  COUNT(*) as count
FROM auth.users au
LEFT JOIN public.profiles p ON au.id = p.user_id
WHERE au.deleted_at IS NULL
GROUP BY profile_status;
```
