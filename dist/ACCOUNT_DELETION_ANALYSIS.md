# üîç **ANALYSIS: Account Deletion Issues**

## üö® **THE ERROR EXPLAINED:**
```
deletion failed: database error: relation public.user_karma_progress does not exist
```

### **Root Cause:**
The current `delete_user_account` function (from `FIX_RPC_FUNCTION.sql`) tries to delete from tables that **don't exist** in your database:

```sql
-- These tables DON'T EXIST in your schema:
DELETE FROM public.user_karma_progress WHERE user_id = p_user_id;  -- ‚ùå Missing table
DELETE FROM public.group_member_karma WHERE user_id = p_user_id;   -- ‚ùå Missing table  
DELETE FROM public.karma_activities WHERE user_id = p_user_id;     -- ‚ùå Missing table
DELETE FROM public.user_achievements WHERE user_id = p_user_id;    -- ‚ùå Missing table
DELETE FROM public.user_engagement WHERE user_id = p_user_id;      -- ‚ùå Missing table
DELETE FROM public.user_switches WHERE user_id = p_user_id;        -- ‚ùå Missing table
```

## üìä **PROPOSED CODE ANALYSIS:**

### ‚úÖ **GOOD ASPECTS:**
- Comprehensive deletion tracking with JSONB return
- Proper user existence verification
- Automatic group member count updates via trigger
- Hard delete from auth.users (complete removal)

### ‚ùå **ISSUES WITH PROPOSED CODE:**
1. **Still references non-existent tables** (posts, comments, notifications)
2. **Missing security check** - doesn't verify user can only delete their own account
3. **Hard delete from auth.users** might break referential integrity
4. **No error handling** for partial failures

## üîß **CORRECTED VERSION FOR YOUR SCHEMA:**

```sql

  END IF;
  
  -- Verify user exists and get email

  IF user_email IS NULL THEN
    RETURN jsonb_build_object(

## üéØ **RECOMMENDATION:**

### ‚ùå **DON'T USE THE PROPOSED CODE AS-IS**
It references tables that don't exist in your schema.

### ‚úÖ **USE THE CORRECTED VERSION ABOVE**
It only deletes from tables that actually exist in your database:
- ‚úÖ `public.profiles`
- ‚úÖ `public.group_members` 
- ‚úÖ `public.chat_messages`
- ‚úÖ `public.message_reactions`
- ‚úÖ `auth.users` (soft delete)

### üîß **IMMEDIATE FIX:**
Replace the current broken function with the corrected version that matches your actual database schema.

## üìã **TABLES THAT ACTUALLY EXIST IN YOUR DB:**
Based on your schema, these are the tables that need cleanup:
- `public.profiles`
- `public.group_members`
- `public.chat_messages`
- `public.message_reactions`
- `public.groups` (update member counts)
- `auth.users` (soft delete)

**The proposed code is good in concept but needs to match your actual database schema!**
